/// Draws a time-positioned line sparkline: the horizontal axis is a fixed window
/// ending at `now`, and each point sits at its real time — so sparse data leaves
/// gaps (blank stretches) rather than being stretched across the width. The line
/// is broken wherever consecutive samples are more than `gapThreshold` apart
/// (missed samples), so we never draw across data we don't have. Vertical scale is
/// 0…max (quiet rests on the bottom line, bursts spike up). The line is drawn in
/// `color`; when `background` is given, a dark panel is filled behind it so the line
/// reads against the theme's dim tone instead of framing hairlines. Kept as a free
/// function so both the menu view and the debug preview share it.
