# Build a distributable, notarized "AI Spend Tracker.app".
#
# Produces a UNIVERSAL binary (arm64 + x86_64) so it runs on both Apple Silicon
# and Intel Macs, targets macOS 13 (Ventura) as the floor, signs with a
# Developer ID Application certificate under a hardened runtime, notarizes with
# Apple, and staples the ticket so it launches cleanly on any Mac — offline and
# without Gatekeeper prompts.
#
# One-time setup (see README "Building a release"):
#   1. A "Developer ID Application" certificate in your login Keychain.
#   2. Notarization credentials stored under a keychain profile:
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials "$NOTARY_PROFILE" \
#          --apple-id <you@example.com> --team-id 7H2524M5TN \
#          --password <app-specific-password>
#
# Output: build/AI Spend Tracker.app  and  build/AISpendTracker.zip (the artifact to
# attach to a GitHub Release).
